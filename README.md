# Drupal site - User Guide (Manual)
> A simple skeleton to create a (printed) User Guide (manual) for Drupal Site Administrators (non-developers, non User 1). 

## About
Have you ever created a Drupal site and need to provide a **written (printed)** documentation for the site Admins, Managers or Authors? This project is for you. "*How to add a new Page*", "*How to Promote a Node on Front Page*" etc are some of the questions that need answer in a User Guide. 

A lot of administrative tasks in Drupal may have the same UI and similar options. For example when you create a Node by default you see on the form fields like `Title`, `URL Alias`, `Promoted to front page` etc. The documentation for these fields can be generic for every site.

Of course, there is the core module [Tour](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/tour) that can help users with inline popups but this will not work for printed manuals.

## Requirements
- Use markdown, json or yml files as source.
- Organize User Guide pages in folder structure.
- Use a static generator to build the Guide (hugo, gatsby, grav etc).
- Allow reader to download each User User Guide page or the whole document as pdf, html, odt.

## Tips
- Do not change the official Drupal terminology. Eg use the word "Node" for content pages. Let your readers learn about Drupal.
- Try to use the default Drupal 8.x admin theme (Seven) or a subtheme based on this. It seems that Seven has the best (UX & UI) support for all the contributed modules. This will make also the screenshots reusable across projects.
- Browser used for screenshots should not have plugins enabled that may affect styling or inputs (eg the LastPass plugin that adds buttons on input)
- Avoid keywords and phrases that are too specific. This will make the manuals reusable.
- Make the texts easy to replace with a simple search and replace process.
- Screenshots should contain only the Main Content region (not sidebars etc) except if you use these regions on the Node Forms.
- Screenshots should not contain the Admin Toolbar or other non related UI elements except if needed.
- Screenshots should use a small - medium device width (eg up to 1200px screen).
- Screenshots of Forms with too many fields or Admin Pages with too many tasks Tasks should split to additional Guide Pages.
- Take individual Screenshots of each element form to create a more detailed Guide.
- Use `masquerade` Drupal module to become the user you create the manuals for.
- Don't explain everything in screenshots that are not so important or never used by users (eg do not explain all the advanced `google_analytics` module settings).
